## CGI Flask Deploy Script

On my hosting plan they use a cgi server for python applications. 
They have no CPannel, so it took some tinkering to get my first Flask app running.

cgi_falsk_deploy.sh is an automated script to deploy a "hello world" Flask app.

## Getting Started

1. Prepare a hosting space and a domain where you intend to host the python app.
2. connect to your space via ssh
3. create a folder named after your domain in the home folder
4. run the script:
   ```sh
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exampleuser/myrepo/main/scripts/myscript.sh | bash
   ```
